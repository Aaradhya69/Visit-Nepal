              <h3>Lumbini, the Birthplace of the Lord Buddha</h3>
              <p>
                Lumbini has a number of old temples, including the Mayadevi
                Temple, and several new temples, funded by Buddhist
                organisations from various countries. Most of the temples have
                already been completed and some are still under construction.
                Many monuments, monasteries and a museum, and the Lumbini
                International Research Institute are also within the holy site.
                Also, there is the Puskarini, or Holy Pond, where Mayadevi, the
                Buddha's mother, is believed to have taken the ritual dip prior
                to his birth and where he also had his first bath. At other
                sites near Lumbini, earlier Buddhas were, according to
                tradition, born, then achieved ultimate Enlightenment and
                finally relinquished their earthly forms. The Government of
                Bangladesh is currently constructing a major Buddhist Monastery
                in Lumbini......<a

              <h3>Janakpur, the Birthplace of the Sita</h3>
              <p>
                Accounts from ascetics, pandits, and bards indicate that
                Janakpur was founded in the early 18th century. The earliest
                description of Janakpur as a pilgrimage site dates to 1805.
                Earlier archaeological evidence of the presence of an ancient
                city has not been found. King Janaka's palace is thought to have
                been located in ancient Janakpur as it is believed to be the
                capital of the Kingdom of the Videhas. According to Ramayana, he
                found a baby girl in a furrow, named her Sita, and raised her as
                his daughter. When she was older, he offered her in marriage to
                anyone who was able to lift the bow of Shiva, left near Janakpur
                a thousand years earlier. Many royal suitors tried but only
                Rama, the prince of Ayodhya, could lift the bow. According to an
                old song, this bow was found northeast of Janakpur....
